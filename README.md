# **Train Line Information Search Application**
The Train Line Information Search Application is designed to provide users with a seamless way to search for train lines and routes using flexible and advanced search criteria. By integrating features like wildcard searches and logical operators, the app ensures that users can quickly and efficiently find the information they need. Below are the key highlights and benefits of this application:

### Key Features
*  Search Functionality:
  *  Wildcard Support: Allows users to include * or % in their search to match any sequence of characters in line names or routes.
  *  Logical Operators: Enables users to combine search criteria with AND/OR logic for more refined results.
  *  Real-Time Updates: Incorporates live data from train schedules and disruption APIs to ensure up-to-date and accurate information.
*  Dynamic Results Display:
  *  Results are shown in a user-friendly table format, clearly listing train line names and their corresponding routes.
  *  Includes a "No Results Found" message for unmatched queries, ensuring clarity and user feedback.

## **Reason for Creating the App**

Enhancing search capabilities for train line information addresses the shortcomings of current tools, which often lack flexibility and comprehensive functionality. This application provides a modern and intuitive solution to these challenges, offering the following benefits:
*  Improved Efficiency: By using advanced search capabilities and real-time data, users can access relevant train line information in seconds.
*  Increased Accuracy: With live updates from trusted APIs, the data is always current, eliminating outdated or incomplete results.
*  User-Friendly Design: By introducing a search function and organising train line data alphabetically (A-Z), the application offers a more intuitive and user-friendly experience. Users can easily navigate and locate specific information without scrolling through long, cumbersome tables, making the process faster and more efficient.

## Prototype Designs

<a href="https://www.figma.com/design/G9aLPGSuBS54DFH1SgEfN6/Web-Train-App?node-id=0-1&t=OQet3OBlkL3XRIQA-1"> Figma Prototype </a>

In my organisation, more than one project designs option go through the option selection review. Green is the best and orange is alternative. Any other option will be categorised as red. In the light of this, I  used Figma to create two design options. The design process involved creating interactive prototypes for each concept, allowing for a more realistic representation of the user experience. These prototypes simulated key functionalities such as the alphabet-based search and result display, providing a clearer vision of how users would interact with the application. While ideally, a user survey would have been conducted to gather quantitative feedback, the current busy period in train infrastructure management and timetabling necessitated a more expedient approach. Instead, I opted for a visual check with colleagues, for a quick response turnaround to make a timely decision. 






### Project Management
For the Train Line Information Search Application, an incremental linear approach was employed using GitHub Projects to streamline development and gradually add features to the prototype. This structured methodology involved upfront requirements gathering, incremental feature development, and rigorous testing of each component before progression. Visual task tracking through a Kanban board facilitated risk management and error detection, enabling quicker delivery of functional prototypes and simplified testing of smaller, manageable increments. The combination of structured workflows and iterative refinement ensured the effective and collaborative development of the application while maintaining flexibility for enhancements.

#### Project Scheduling and Review
To capture and manage requirements for the Train Line Information Search Application, I utilised GitHub Issues and a comprehensive feature branching strategy within the project repository. Each requirement was documented as a separate issue with descriptive titles, detailed descriptions, and relevant labels for easy categorisation. I created dedicated feature branches for each new functionality or task, allowing for isolated development and testing. As work progressed, these branches were managed through pull requests, which facilitated code review and simulated would-be discussion before merging changes into the main branch.

The GitHub Projects Kanban board was used to visualise these issues and track their progress, with columns representing different stages of development (e.g., "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done"). When a feature was completed and tested, the corresponding pull request was created to merge the branch into the main branch. This approach enabled systematic requirement tracking, facilitated collaborative development, and provided a transparent view of the project's status.

By leveraging GitHub's issue tracking, feature branching, and pull request features, I could incrementally add and refine features to the prototype. This method ensured visibility into the project's scope and progress, supporting effective communication, development, and delivery of the Train Line Information Search Application.
